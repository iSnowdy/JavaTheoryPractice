Interfaces are a special type of class that define the behaviour of the classes that implement them.

They kind of act as a blueprint.

Interfaces are a way of achieving abstraction. They can have variables and methods.
    - Variables -> they are public, static and final by default
    - Methods -> they are abstract and public by default

Therefore, interfaces are primarily used to define methods that other classes must implement.

Classes cannot extend to more than one abstract class. However, they can implement multiple interfaces. This
opens the gate to multiple inheritance.
