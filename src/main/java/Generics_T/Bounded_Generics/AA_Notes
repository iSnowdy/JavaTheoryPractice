Generics - Basics                  |
-----------------------------------|

Java Generics are a way of parametrizing classes and interfaces so that instead of using a specific type of
data we use a template (<E>).

However, sometimes we need to apply some restrictions. So that we can narrow down the generic. This is called "bound
types".

A classic example of a generic is a List in Java ---> List<E>. We can make a list of anything: String, Integer, Objects...

But if we want to restrict it so we can, for example, only create String lists, we can narrow it down using classes or
interfaces.
